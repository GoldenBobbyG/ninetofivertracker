# Title
NINE TO FIVER TRACKER

## Description
challenge involves building a TypeScript-based command-line interface (CLI) for managing company departments, roles, and employees using Inquirer for user input and a PostgreSQL database for data storage. The script provides a menu-driven experience, allowing users to view, add, and update records while ensuring proper database relationships, including one-to-many and self-referential structures. The project requires handling asynchronous database connections, implementing CRUD operations, and maintaining a structured database schema with foreign keys to enforce data integrity.

## Installation
To complete this challenge, use PostgreSQL to create the database, run a seed file to populate initial data, and install dependencies by running npm i before executing the CLI application.

## Usage
Add in Git

## Contribution
None

## Tests
Navigate the menu using the command-line interface to view add, and update departments, roles, and employees.
