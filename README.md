# Title
NINE TO FIVER TRACKER

## Description
challenge involves building a TypeScript-based command-line interface (CLI) for managing company departments, roles, and employees using Inquirer for user input and a PostgreSQL database for data storage. The script provides a menu-driven experience, allowing users to view, add, and update records while ensuring proper database relationships, including one-to-many and self-referential structures. The project requires handling asynchronous database connections, implementing CRUD operations, and maintaining a structured database schema with foreign keys to enforce data integrity.

## Installation
To complete this challenge, use PostgreSQL to create the database, run a seed file to populate initial data, and install dependencies by running npm i before executing the CLI application.

## Usage
### **Usage Information:**  
1. **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm i` to install all required packages.  
2. **Set Up Database:** Use PostgreSQL to create the necessary database.  
3. **Run Seed File:** Execute the seed script to populate the database with initial data.  
4. **Start the CLI:** Run `node index.js` (or `ts-node index.ts` for TypeScript) to launch the application.  
5. **Navigate the Menu:** Use the command-line interface to view, add, and update departments, roles, and employees.  
6. **Exit the Application:** Select the **"EXIT"** option to close the program and disconnect from the database.
